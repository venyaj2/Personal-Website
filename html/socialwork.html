            <h2>About the Author</h2>
            <p>From a young age, social justice has been at the heart of my endeavors. I celebrated every birthday at <strong>Feed My Starving Children (FMSC)</strong>, and in high school, I actively volunteered at <strong>PADS Homeless Shelter</strong> and engaged in social entrepreneurship through <strong>Maa</strong>, an app designed to address undiagnosed prenatal and postpartum depression, which won 2nd place nationally at the <strong>Business Professionals of America (BPA)</strong> competition. My internship with <strong>Stop Diabetes Movement (SDM)</strong> involved educating at-risk groups on health inequity and diabetes prevention.</p>
    
            <p>At the end of high school, I conducted a research paper on <strong>Quiet Room Maltreatment</strong>, addressing the educational system's lack of policy and procedure when working with students, especially those marginalized by race and ability.</p>
    
            <p>In college, I pursued computer science to leverage it against social injustices. My coursework spanned diversity, Asian American experiences, law and policy, social entrepreneurship, human and social development, and grant writing. I recorded diverse human narratives, focusing on the immigrant experience, and authored a grant for the <strong>Greater Community AIDS Project</strong>, aiding individuals with HIV/AIDS.</p>
    
            <p>I served as a board member for <strong>Project4Less</strong> throughout my college years, combating food waste and insecurity by repackaging surplus dining hall food for the Wesley Food Pantry and educating the campus on systemic causes of food apartheid. Additionally, I participated in <strong>UIUC's 2024 Solidarity Encampment for Palestine</strong> and other protests and vigils, solidifying my commitment to policy and social entrepreneurship.</p>
